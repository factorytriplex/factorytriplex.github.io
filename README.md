Factory Triplex is the fifth installation of the Factory 55 series. The first, Factory 55, was released about three or four years ago but received little traction. The next,
Factory 55 2, became slightly popular among the members of my school. Next was Factory Deux which received a monstrous amount of players. Later, I programmed Factory Bricks, which was
Factory Deux written in Node.js and playable on the sandbox website Brick Hill (brick-hill.net).
